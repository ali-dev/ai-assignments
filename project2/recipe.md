Recipe Name: Creamy Chicken and Bacon Carbonara with Peas
Ingredients list: - **Pasta:**
  - 12 oz (340g) penne pasta
- **Chicken:**
  - 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
- **Bacon:**
  - 6 slices of bacon, chopped
- **Peas:**
  - 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- **Carbonara Sauce:**
  - 3 large eggs
  - 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 1/2 cup heavy cream
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - Freshly ground black pepper to taste
- **Garnish:**
  - Fresh parsley, chopped
  - Extra Parmesan cheese for serving
Instructions: 1. **Cook the Pasta:**
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  - Cook the penne pasta according to package instructions until al dente.
  - Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
  - Season the diced chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
  - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
  - Add the chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
  - Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Cook the Bacon:**
  - In the same skillet, add the chopped bacon.
  - Cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
  - Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess fat.
  - Leave a small amount of bacon fat in the skillet for added flavor.

4. **Prepare the Carbonara Sauce:**
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, heavy cream, minced garlic, and freshly ground black pepper until well combined.

5. **Combine Everything:**
  - Return the skillet with the reserved bacon fat to medium heat.
  - Add the cooked pasta, chicken, bacon, and thawed peas to the skillet.
  - Toss everything together until well combined and heated through.
  - Remove the skillet from heat and slowly pour the carbonara sauce over the pasta mixture, tossing continuously to ensure the sauce evenly coats the pasta and doesnâ€™t scramble the eggs.
  - If the sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.

6. **Serve:**
  - Divide the creamy chicken and bacon carbonara with peas among serving plates.
  - Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.
  - Serve immediately and enjoy!

**Tips:**
- Make sure to remove the skillet from the heat before adding the carbonara sauce to prevent the eggs from scrambling.
- Use freshly grated Parmesan cheese for the best flavor and texture.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of garlic and black pepper to suit your taste.
